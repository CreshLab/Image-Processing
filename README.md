## Introduction
This project provides practical examples of the main medical image segmentation techniques coding in Python.
Image segmentation is critical for many clinical use-cases, such as computer-aided diagnosis, surgical planning and therapy monitoring.

Techniques included in this project:
- Thresholding
- K-means Clustering
- Edge Detection

## Requirements
- python 3.x
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scikit-image
- matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/CreshLab/Image-Processing/segmentation.git

# Move to project directory
cd segmentation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
